# Data Profiling Report

## Table Summary
This table represents a collection of detailed personal records for individuals. Each person is identified by an **Id**, and may also have an **SSN**, **DRIVERS** license, or **PASSPORT** number. Their full name is detailed with **PREFIX**, **FIRST**, **LAST**, **SUFFIX**, and a **MAIDEN** name if applicable.

The records include vital and demographic information such as **BIRTHDATE**, **DEATHDATE**, **MARITAL** status, **RACE**, **ETHNICITY**, and **GENDER**. Geographic information specifies the person's **BIRTHPLACE** and their current residential **ADDRESS**, **CITY**, **STATE**, **COUNTY**, **FIPS** code, **ZIP**, and geographic coordinates (**LAT**, **LON**). Finally, the table contains financial information related to an individual's **HEALTHCARE_EXPENSES**, **HEALTHCARE_COVERAGE**, and **INCOME**.

## Data Type Analysis
- **BIRTHDATE**: object → *datetime64* (The column contains date values in a standard 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.)
- **DEATHDATE**: object → *datetime64* (The column contains date values and empty strings, which can be represented as dates and Not a Time (NaT) values.)
- **PREFIX**: object → *category* (The column has a small number of repeated string values (e.g., 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Ms.'), making it ideal for the memory-efficient category type.)
- **SUFFIX**: object → *category* (This column likely contains a small, fixed set of name suffixes (e.g. 'Jr.', 'Sr.'), making it suitable for the category type.)
- **MARITAL**: object → *category* (The column represents marital status and likely has a small number of distinct values ('M', 'S', etc.), making it ideal for the category type.)
- **RACE**: object → *category* (The column contains a small, well-defined set of values for race, which is a classic categorical variable.)
- **ETHNICITY**: object → *category* (The column contains a small, well-defined set of values for ethnicity, making it a categorical variable.)
- **GENDER**: object → *category* (The column has a very small number of distinct values ('M', 'F'), making it a prime candidate for the category type.)
- **CITY**: object → *category* (The number of unique city names is much smaller than the total number of records, making 'category' a memory-efficient choice.)
- **STATE**: object → *category* (The number of unique states is very small and fixed, making this an ideal categorical variable.)
- **COUNTY**: object → *category* (The number of unique counties is finite and much smaller than the number of records, making 'category' a memory-efficient choice.)
- **FIPS**: float64 → *category* (FIPS codes are categorical identifiers for geographic locations. Using 'category' is memory efficient and semantically correct as they are not used for mathematical operations.)
- **ZIP**: int64 → *category* (ZIP codes are geographic identifiers. While numeric, they are not used for calculations. Using 'category' is memory-efficient and avoids issues with leading zeros.)

## Missing Values Analysis
**Overview**: The dataset exhibits both meaningful and problematic missingness. Fields like DEATHDATE, SUFFIX, and MAIDEN have high percentages of missing values that are expected and informative, indicating a specific status (e.g., 'alive' or 'not applicable'). Conversely, fields like MARITAL and FIPS have missing values that represent genuine data quality gaps, hindering demographic and geographic analysis.

### Problematic Missing Values
- **PREFIX**: 10 missing (16.7%) - Prefixes (Mr., Ms., etc.) are often optional fields. While their absence is common, it represents incomplete data rather than a specific status, making it a minor data quality issue.
- **MARITAL**: 20 missing (33.3%) - Marital status is a core demographic attribute. A 33.3% missing rate is a significant data quality problem, as the absence does not imply a default status (like 'single') and creates gaps in analysis.
- **FIPS**: 14 missing (23.3%) - FIPS is a standardized geographic code for a county. Since COUNTY data exists, the FIPS code should be derivable. Its absence is a data processing or quality issue that hinders standardized geographic analysis.

### Likely Meaningful Missing Values
- **DEATHDATE**: 50 missing (83.3%) - The high percentage of missing values (83.3%) strongly suggests that a blank DEATHDATE indicates the person is still alive. The absence of data is the data.
- **DRIVERS**: 6 missing (10.0%) - A missing driver's license number likely means the person does not have one, which could be due to age (minors) or personal choice. It is not necessarily an error.
- **PASSPORT**: 13 missing (21.7%) - Similar to a driver's license, not every individual has a passport. A missing value indicates the person likely does not possess one.
- **SUFFIX**: 56 missing (93.3%) - Name suffixes (Jr., III, etc.) are rare. The very high percentage of missing values (93.3%) correctly reflects that most people do not have one.
- **MAIDEN**: 49 missing (81.7%) - A maiden name is only applicable to a subset of the population (typically, married individuals who changed their name). A blank value is expected for males, unmarried individuals, or those who kept their original name.

## Uniqueness Analysis
### Candidate Key Columns
- **Id**: This column is a system-generated unique identifier (like a UUID) for each record. The table context states it identifies each person, and the data analysis confirms it is 100% unique. It's designed specifically to be a primary key.
- **SSN**: A Social Security Number is a government-issued number intended to be a unique identifier for each person in the United States. It is 100% unique in the sample data and is a strong candidate for a natural key, despite its sensitive nature.

### Highly Unique Columns
- **BIRTHDATE**: 83.3% unique
- **DRIVERS**: 90.0% unique
- **PASSPORT**: 78.3% unique
- **FIRST**: 98.3% unique
- **LAST**: 88.3% unique
- **BIRTHPLACE**: 80.0% unique
- **ADDRESS**: 100.0% unique
- **CITY**: 66.7% unique
- **ZIP**: 60.0% unique
- **LAT**: 100.0% unique
- **LON**: 100.0% unique
- **HEALTHCARE_EXPENSES**: 100.0% unique
- **HEALTHCARE_COVERAGE**: 98.3% unique
- **INCOME**: 83.3% unique

## Unusual Values Detection
- **SSN**: All sample values begin with the area number '999'. The Social Security Administration (SSA) does not issue SSNs with area numbers (the first three digits) in the 900-999 range. These values are invalid and likely represent dummy or placeholder data.
- **FIRST**: The column 'FIRST' is expected to contain first names. However, all sample values are a mix of text and numbers (e.g., 'Mel236', 'Cheyenne169'). This suggests that names have been concatenated with a numeric ID or code, which is unusual for a standard first name field.
- **LAST**: The values in the 'LAST' column consistently follow a pattern of a name followed by a three-digit number (e.g., 'Bailey598'). This is unusual because a column named 'LAST' is expected to contain only the last name. The presence of appended numbers suggests a potential data quality issue where a name and a numeric ID have been merged into a single field.
- **MAIDEN**: The values in the 'MAIDEN' column consistently follow a pattern of a name followed by a sequence of numbers (e.g., 'Lowe577'). A column representing a maiden name would typically contain only alphabetic characters. The presence of appended numbers is unusual and suggests the column may be a concatenation of a name and a numeric identifier.
- **FIPS**: The values appear to be valid 5-digit county FIPS codes. However, they are stored as floats (float64) instead of strings. FIPS codes are identifiers, not numerical quantities, and should be stored as strings to prevent issues like the loss of leading zeros (e.g., '01001' becoming 1001.0) and to reflect their categorical nature. The trailing '.0' in each sample is an artifact of this incorrect data type.
- **ZIP**: The value '0' is present, which is not a valid ZIP or postal code. This value likely represents missing data, a default entry, or an error during data conversion.
- **HEALTHCARE_COVERAGE**: The presence of `0.0` is unusual. It's ambiguous whether this represents a valid state (no coverage) or is a placeholder for missing data. Additionally, the data has a very wide range, and the value `1777031.06` is a potential high-end outlier, being significantly larger than the other sample values.
